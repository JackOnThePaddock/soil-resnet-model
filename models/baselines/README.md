# Baseline Models

Trained baseline models are stored here after running:

```bash
python scripts/train_baselines.py --data data/processed/features.csv --output models/baselines/
```

Baseline models include SVR, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Cubist, and GPR.
These are not tracked in git due to size. Only the ResNet ensemble weights are included.
